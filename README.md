This is Project 38 from Hacking with Swift by Paul Hudson. Functionally, this demo app loads the 100 most recent commits from a Github repo, merges this into the on-device data store and displays this as a scrolling list on screen. But the project was designed by Paul Hudson as a learning excercise in a mix of the following technologies:
1. SwiftyJSON - used to parse the JSON data format and convert the data into a Swift-friendly format.
2. CoreData - an abstracted version of SQLite. Somewhat outdated because Swift will gradually migrate to SwiftData.
3. UIKit - the older framework to build the user interface. Somewhat outdatd because Swift projects are migrating to SwiftUI.

In my current personal project, I want to combine SwiftyJSON / CoreData / SwiftUI.

Changes made to the original source code are minor:
- some renaming (Hacking with Swift uses short variable names here and there for practical reasons)
- fixed the extra warnings generated by SwiftLint 0.53 (mainly line length, even in template code generated by Xcode)
